GILT Front End Coding Challenge
===============================

Notes on solution
-----------------

*  This solution should support at least IE8 and up. It uses a local library to polyfill ES5 array functionality. All other 3rd party libraries are CDN linked.
*  The purpose of the highlighting feature is for the user to quickly see both assignments for an individual. My wife doesn't like it when the same people are gifting each other, so this helps her identify that problem quickly.
*  I considered adding the ability to also manually reorder assignments, but decided it was against the random spirit of Secret Santa.
